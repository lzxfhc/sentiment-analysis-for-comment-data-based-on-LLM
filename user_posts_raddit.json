The use of ChatGPT to solve puzzles in Genshin Impact is a great example of this. The Redditor's approach of transforming the in-game puzzle into a word problem that ChatGPT could solve is particularly impressive. As a language model that is designed to replicate human-like behavior, I'm always glad to see players utilize my capabilities in such innovative ways.\n>\n>However, it's worth noting that while using ChatGPT to solve puzzles is an interesting and creative approach, it may not always be the most efficient solution. As some commenters have pointed out, certain characters in the game can make solving puzzles much easier. For example, Yae Miko's ability to trigger Electro puzzles with her Sesshou Sakura totems is a powerful tool for exploring the Inazuma nation.\n>\n>It's also worth noting that the Genshin Impact community is constantly evolving, with new updates and rumors of upcoming features and characters. While Yae Miko is currently a popular character for exploring the Inazuma region, the introduction of new characters and updates may change the best strategies for solving puzzles. It's exciting to see how players will continue to adapt and innovate in this ever-changing world.",

    "“‘AI gaming trend sparks new era of reporting for video game journalists!’ by ChatGPT\n\nIn the past, video game journalists would usually cover the latest releases or provide walkthroughs for difficult levels in new games. However, with the rise of AI language models, like ChatGPT, players are now using these technologies to help them beat levels and solve puzzles in their favorite games. As a result, video game journalists are increasingly reporting on how players are using AI to enhance their gaming experience.\n\nA recent article on Gamerant discussed how players of the popular game, Genshin Impact, used ChatGPT to solve a puzzle in the game's newest region in Inazuma. The article notes that the puzzle required players to arrange a set of keywords in a specific order to unlock a door. However, the order of the keywords was not explicitly given in the game, making the puzzle challenging for many players. As a result, players turned to ChatGPT, an AI language model created by OpenAI, to analyze the game's dialogue and provide hints on the order of the keywords. With the help of ChatGPT, players were able to solve the puzzle and progress in the game.\n\nThis use of AI in gaming is becoming increasingly common. As more games require players to solve puzzles, overcome difficult bosses, or navigate complex environments, AI language models like ChatGPT can enhance the gaming experience for players. In addition to Genshin Impact, other games like Minecraft and Dark Souls have seen players utilize AI to help them navigate the gameplay.\n\nVideo game journalists are taking notice of this trend and providing coverage and analysis of how players are using AI to assist them in their gaming. This new approach to video game journalism is opening up discussions on the relationship between gaming and AI, as well as the future of gaming technology. It also highlights how the use of AI can change the way we approach gaming challenges and the potential for AI to enhance the overall gaming experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of AI language models like ChatGPT to enhance gaming experiences is becoming increasingly popular among players in the gaming community. As a result, video game journalists are providing more coverage of how these technologies are being used to solve puzzles and navigate gameplay. This trend showcases how advancements in AI technology can revolutionize the gaming experience and spark new discussions about the future of gaming.”",

    "That is a very... uninformed answer. This AI does not have access to up-to-date information on the internet, and it can't browse the internet either.\n\nAI's right now can solve a lot of puzzles that are much much much harder. This has been happening for decades now, a prominent example is the multitude of unbeatable chess bots. So it isn't about impressiveness, just that the user thought of a \"new\" way to solve puzzles.\n\nAnd this puzzle was never really hard to begin with, it's just a pain to move the blocks and then with the instructions you don't really know if what you guess it might be is really the intended answer. I solved it twice, it's not that hard, but it takes just a little more time and effort than the standard 2-second-think puzzles scattered throughout Genshin.\n\nThe funny part is that Yae's fox turrets solve these puzzles by themselves, and the 2nd time my watatsumi puzzle reset (so the third time) I wanted to see if they'd actually solve this bigger puzzle. I alt-tabbed to watch a youtube video because they didn't get it immediately, but after just 2 minutes of watching and refreshing turrets, I heard the chest appear.\n\nThe fox turret AI is able to solve this puzzle lmao, you don't need chatgpt, or even look outside the game or think yourself, as long as you got the Limited 5 star Miko lol.",

ChatGPT is able to replicate human-like behavior and can be used to solve word problems. The player was able to transform an in-game puzzle into a word problem and ChatGPT was able to give an accurate solution. This is a new and interesting way to solve puzzles in Genshin Impact and it could be a helpful tool for players who are struggling with difficult puzzles.\n\nOverall, there are a few different ways to solve puzzles in Genshin Impact. Players can use ChatGPT, specific characters, or their own creativity to find solutions.\n\nNow, in my opinion I think that the article is just there so it would increase engagement to the site 💀. I don't know but to my cyno senses gamerant typically writes articles that's just for clicks.\n\nBut that's modern video game journalism.\n\nCyno cyning out!",

    "You are correct. After a quick doodle in paint, the solution from chatGPT is not complete, but very close. As of step 8 square D will face south, while all three others will face east. Step 8 needs to be executed twice in order to solve the puzzle correctly.\n\nApart from that, I just think that skill issue is just a negative expression, because it is often used as an insult in video games and I don't think OP deserves that, because he found a creative workaround for his problem, even if the solution is slightly flawed. Not everybody can be strong in logic puzzles. Plus he put more effort into finding a solution for a problem in a video game than some of the people I work with do with their daily tasks.",
    "When you solve complex math problems do you use a calculator or do you calculate everything by hand? And if you use a calculator, wouldn't you still say that you solved your task on your own? I think so at least, because it requires knowledge on how to use your chosen tool and how to articulate your problem.\n\nChatGPT is of course more powerful than a calculator, but OP took an issue, understood what he wanted and gave a detailed explanation to ChatGPT in order to solve it. It is not like he put zero effort into solving his problem.",

    "Come on just let this smartass cook and get his ego fix for once.",
    "Considering it's one of the puzzle with only 4 pillars, it's probably not one of the harder ones.\n\nAlso, this felt more like a thought-experiment/challenge for chatGPT more than a legitimate struggle, but okay",

IIRC, it pretty much boils down to swapping two or three pieces, and the majority of the moves are just busywork, getting the other pieces out of their way.\n\nIt's not that hard, it's just really, really drawn out because of how tedious the sliding statue animation is. It comes down to basic puzzle-solving skill of isolating what the actual problem is. The majority of the puzzle is more or less a distraction.",
    "Bro had a thing think for him. Are we really equating \"describing things\" to formulating math problems from limited data? Damn, education really did take a hit. \n\nA better tool for this situation woulda been google, so I guess theres also a tool selection skill issue at play.",

It's too much to reply to every single person about this, so hopefully this will clear up a misunderstanding I keep seeing below. What you see here in the video is the worst I've ever seen or experienced in Genshin on PS4. This sort of issue never happened before 3.0, but it has become more prevalent as new Sumeru subregions get added. It also usually only happens in Sumeru as well. Mondstadt, Liyue, and Inazuma in their entireties load in perfectly fine. And again, what's shown in the video is rare. I made the comment that PS4 is nearly as bad as mobile because a lot of people try to say that mobile is the worst experience in Genshin, and in co-op they will invalidate other people on other platforms about their problems because \"at least you're not on mobile.\" I know because I've experienced it firsthand.\n\nBelieve it or not, some people don't buy the newest phones on the market, nor do some people buy iPhones or Android. When people talk about the mobile experience, it's with a large variety of phones in a larger variety of countries. If I have to pay more that 150 USD on a phone (and even that maximum amount sounds absurd) just to get a better experience than what's shown in the video, I may as well stick with the PS4 or save up money for the PS5 (or build my own PC to play it). It's not as bad as this video makes it out to be. It's just that the PS4 *is* slowly aging out as the map expands, and it will cause more issues overtime, which should be addressed in some way.",
    "The HDD is to blame, can't believe Sony does not even bother to have proper SSD support (because replacing the SSD in PS4 still does not take advantage of it due to most games are hardcoded for PS4 slow HDD), even though PS4 games are specifically made for PS4, they are still bottlenecked by HDD, causing textures rendering very slowly, happens on all modern games",

Also, optimizing a game for 1 device is much easier than doing it for over 1000 different phones. It's actually weird that they cant let it run properly on the PS4 considering their massive budget. Even if they Cant get it Running, their is always cloud gaming which is very doable on switch.",

The only problem I really had back then was getting Venti on his second rerun and the abyss lagging like crazy with him in it, but they patched that pretty soon after. It was always rocky after patches but that’s it, they always fixed it.

    "SSD: Solid State Drive\n\nIt's a memory solution and how much memory and what type of drive will be part of you \"main\" specs when it comes to computer/\"computer-like\" devices!\n\nBasically, SSDs are hard drives with no moving parts. Older hard drives (HDD) had a spinning disk that information would be written on and read while it spinned. SSD is what you'll see in most computers nowadays (though really high end computers have started using NVMEs, but that's another matter- just think of it as another type of storage solution).\n\nMeanwhile, microSD is a smaller hard drive with less capacity, less reliability, and slower than a SSD, but are ideal for portable devices due to its small size! Both microSD and SSD have no moving parts too so even a microSD is an improvement in technology compared to old",
    "Adding on to the other comment, hard drives (HDD) need to spin up the disks (they power down to save power and to not wear out the motors as fast) and then find the data, while SDDs can find that data almost instantaneously since there's no moving parts. This is what I meant by seek time, so how long it takes before data actually starts loading, for Genshin for example, the terrain.\n\nWhich is what I think happened for OP, it was probably still looking for the akademiya assets but couldn't find and load them in fast enough.",

    "The Chinese language from which they’re translating from is capable of conveying more info in fewer words, so when the text gets turned into English it’ll inevitably end up on the “bloated” side.\n\nThe alternative is to just cut out more nuance for the sake of keeping things short... but then the other side of the fandom will accuse the localization team of being lazy and butchering the original text. It’s hard to please both sides.",
    "The problem is, nothing is conveyed. I sit around in every damn cutscene with the same minor point being resaid over and over again because they can't just say a damn thing and then do it. We have to talk over every single thing a million times from each character at length before moving on.\n\n\"We'll setup an ambush and attack as they come through\"\n\nTurns into 2-4 separate VO lines of several sentences in each line from a character, only for a no name npc to comment on it, paimon to ask about it, the first character to re-iterate the point, the no name npc chiming in that sounds good, paimon saying it sounds good, for the first character to again restate what they're going to do and how it'll work out.\n\nIt's not just the way of speaking, it's the fact almost nothing is ever said of importance by any character or the important fact is a several word nugget buried in a paragraph of pointless text.",
    "I don’t really care about this in the dialogues but it does get annoying in the game tutorials, where it’s completely unnecessary. Why use such a flowery and complicated language when you are telling players how to interact with a new mechanic? Isn’t it supposed to be as simple to understand as possible? Thanks for formatting the key words in yellow bold at least.",

    "It’s not overly academic, it’s overly wordy and grammatically suspect. It’s also really vanilla and boring most of the time, plus there’s like 5,000 different story lines so most of them are undeveloped or practically indistinguishable from the rest",
    "I wouldn't call it academic-level language exactly, but this game has a HUGE problem with everyone speaking in incredibly roundabout ways. When they take three entire paragraphs to explain what could've been summed up in a single sentence, it comes across as stilted regardless of the reading level.",
    "The biggest issue for me is that there is a big ass text box but the game only does 2 lines of text at a time.",
    "I never got that impression that genshin had academic level dialogue. I think it drags out a bit but thats a thing ive noticed in anime fantasy in general. One thing I thought was interesting was how many poetic metaphors are used in casual conversation in Genshin, after a while I figured it 's common in Chinese to use metaphors like that often. That's just a guess though",
    "I have 0 chinese knowledge ,but i think it might have to do with the source materials. Pretty much everything i read in english thats translated from chinese are super bloated.\n\nMost of my experience is from wuxia and arknights tho.",
    "I get the same feeling when playing Genshin. There's just so much fluff as well - as if the writers had to hit some word count for every quest. NPCs will spend about four times as many words as necessary to convey information. Paimon then has to repeat every concept for some reason. Some quests are just downright hard to read like the Aranananarana stuff. Combined with how clunky the dialogue skip mechanic is (have to wait for animations to finish before skipping), the story quest experience is pretty exhausting.\n\nIt's immediately noticeable when you switch to another game and realize the dialogue experience is way better.",
    "like when an npc introduce domains in those random events (like the current event), I just end up clicking through their long-winded dialogue",
    "I've only really had this problem since Sumeru came out, though I've been thoroughly enjoying the stories anyways. I feel like there are more and more terms being thrown in from the various languages from the cultures the ones in the game are inspired by and I can't quite keep track of them all sometimes. Just in this new region alone there are like 5 new _important_ jargon terms and a whole slew of others of varying importance.",
    "It does seem like most characters are always trying to prove how smart they are. This is why Itto is so refreshing.",
    "I don't really care how much they say on that front but sometimes I just want the frigging story to move along faster while everyone is saying entire essays just to say \"abyss order doing bad things, we kill now\" XD.",
    "Its the genshin storytelling problem of bloated dialogue. They can say a thousand words and most of it meant absolutely nothing in value. Its also just he issue of the game being 90% telling than actually showing so its exhausting to just sit still and listen to word vomit of someone just wanting some apples.",
    "youre not alone op, ive been complaining about this for forever. this also makes quests a slog to get through, makes lore needlessly confusing, and makes voice acting performances sound stiff and unnatural. it sucks, its grating, its annoying, and im begging the localization team to make changes.\n\ni know that the language they’re translating from has words that describe things in a way that english can’t, and that because of this the englist translation /has/ to be longer to capture all that nuance but there has to be a balance somewhere. \n\nevery sentence and line of dialogue has so much filler and fluff and useless meandering that by the time you get to the end of an interaction nothing of worth sticks with the audience and you have people going through quests with no idea why things are happening or what’s even going on and every 2-3 business days someone comes on here begging for a skip button because the dialogue is so flowery it comes off as uninteresting.\n\nside note - i don’t think this is a purely cn -> en problem as ive seen more than a couple japanese streamers struggle with weapon and artifact names/descriptions and some dialogue due to the kanji being too uncommon/difficult to read without furigana. a different issue than what we’re dealing with but along the same vein.",
    "Yes. \n\nI'm so tired of paragraphs of boring text that could be simplified down to \"Go here, do thing, come back. Thanks.\"",
    "It isn't exhausting, it's just poorly written and excessively verbose. I don't have a problem with walls of text. I've read many 100+ hour visual novels. But Genshin's dialogue often bores me to death, and I really don't understand why a multi-billion dollar company still can't get this right.",
    "It’s funny, because no matter how many big intellectual words the NPCs use to convey their thoughts, they still sound fucking stupid because they take 4 times as long to express basic ideas as they need to and they ask you for the same commissions over and over and over again for the most random ass shit ever. I highly doubt this issue is better in other languages tbh.",
    "I have the same feelings with the french translation. It's not convoluted and yet it tires me with how it drags on with simple words. Throw in untranslated local words (Vijnanapati etc) and I lose focus quickly :/",
    "Completely agree and I'm glad there's finally a post about it.  \n\n\nHonestly it feels like the translators (or maybe writers) are like those kids in high school who wanted to sound really smart so they took every commonly used word and put it through a thesaurus so they could use a longer, more complex version of the same thing.  \n\n\nIt really does lead to word / sentence bloat and it makes it harder to keep focused on the topic at hand.  I've thought in the past, \"maybe I'm just stupid,\" but it's honestly just poor writing.  I lose focus of the dialogue / story while playing Genshin and often times find myself wondering what I just read in the last sentence.  This is a Genshin problem.  When I've read stories from popular writers, I get absorbed in them, easily process what I'm reading, and retain the information I've just read.  \n\n\nGenshin also has a problem with using *way* too many names and pronouns.  Every sentence is jam packed with the names of two people, three places, a religion, two conceptual beliefs, a god, and probably someone's pet.  It makes it really hard for your brain to juggle all of these literally new words (b/c they're fictional so you have to start remembering them now) especially when they *also* like to give multiple people/places/things multiple names.  Yeah dude, thanks for naming this entity/god/king three different names and they just any one of the three any time.  When they started putting their smaller text above their main text to help readers I cracked up.",
    "A bit why I got burned out from the Golden Slumber quests lol",
    "Are you sure you didnt install the game in Fischl instead of english? :P\n\nBut I partially agree, some dialogues are too bloated when they are only serving a practical function.",
    "I honestly wish the skip button was better. You might as well read the text given how long it takes to react.",
    "I feel like it’s not only bad dialogue(though that is a big factor) but just storytelling in general. Genshin will never be a perfect story because of its limitations like it’s visual novel style of storytelling, it’s 3D models, NPC designs, etc. Characters are always blabbing about things that could be said in one sentence and since they are all doing it(and every character needs to get one piece of flavor text in every time), every conversation turns into a white noise of exposition. Also it has been said before, but lore>>>>story. You’ll hear about these epic battles, compelling character developments, impressive events that have happened in the world, but you will never see them in game because that would take a lot of animation and time to show, so you are left standing in a circle summarizing said lore or discussing some arbitrary decision you plan to make in the near future, which will be repeated across multiple sentences, and multiple characters. Even though Sumeru was a big step up from Inazuma, it is still mostly tell and not show, which will hinder the story no matter how developed they make it. I think this snail pace story is mostly due to the live service nature of the game. Characters are stagnant, developments are rare or hidden, and there are little to no stakes for 90% of the plot points and characters in the game. And I think this plain, friendly approach to storytelling is such a shame considering the game has darker and suggested depth to some of its plot points.\nSorry for the rant!",
    "The writing has a bad habit of constantly repeating itself. In particular, it will 'show you' an event happening and then have the characters tell you about the event again in the same scene. \n\nThis happens constantly in the game and why I get burnt out doing story so quickly.",
    "Word bloat is very real and tiring in Genshin, unfortunately I'm not seeing it changing as most are content with it. \n\nSkip button cannot come sooner and sadly never will eh...",
    "People like to meme on Fischl talking in this big, grand and overly sophisticated manner when in reality EVERYONE talks like this",
    "The ocean of bland, unskippable dialogue is the #1 reason I gave up on completing events. Now I go months at a time barely touching the game because I refuse to deal with the hundreds of ways it loves to test your patience. I adore genshin but I just have no patience for it.",
    "I wouldn't mind nearly so much if they also let you click through dialogue animations. Its the combination of the super wordy dialogue plus the fact I need to wait 5-6 seconds for Paimon to complete her little pout-stomp before I can get to the next line that exhausts me.\n\nJust cut to the next position/animation when I push the button, please. I know that means some characters may \"teleport\" between lines. I don't care. I'm used to it from other games.\n\nAlong with \"this character is busy with another quest,\" it feels like one of those things done for \"realism\" (characters don't teleport, can't be in two places at once, etc.) that is totally unnecessary and actually hurts quality of life for players.",
    "I just think Genshin just doesn’t have enjoyable dialogue most of the time. It’s just not natural or interesting a lot of the time.",
    "I miss so much lore because I refuse to read through endless text boxes with endless dialogue, most of which is pointless. Even when you click the “end conversation” dialogue option you get like 3 more text boxes of them saying goodbye. Like please… just say “see you later!”",
    "It's written in a way to waste maximum amount of your time.",
    "It doesn't help that there's so much fucking reading in the overworld shit. Like, bro, I just want to explore and fight shit, but I can't because half the zone is tied behind world quests and the world quests ask me to go through 10 minutes of reading (it'd at least be better if it was voiced), just do walk 5 minutes, maybe do a braindead easy fight in 2 seconds, then read another 10 minute cutscene.\n\nI wanna know wtf is going on because it's actually interesting, so I don't skip or skim too hard, but holy fuck do they talk a LOT.",
    "The localizers of Genshin tend to over-translate everything",
    "Reason why I could read entires books in Pyre or other VN games but barely an archon quest in Genshin. They could tell me the most amazing story ever, but how they present it is awful. Walls of texts thst says nothing, Paimon repeating shit and those stupid animations and camera angles makes every quest a slog to go through. And we can't even skip it.",
    "It’s honestly awful sometimes. I think it’s a balance thing…I am totally fine with flowery prose, I love picking up obscure new words here and there - but to have SO MANY characters written like literature professors, it’s just too much.\n\nI get that Chinese allows you to say more with less, and that’s cool, but I wish the localizers would bias towards, “how would *this* character say that” (more varied and realistic) instead of “what’s the most *efficient* way to translate this” (skewed towards complex vocabulary).",
    "My bigger problem with the writing is how long they take to explain everything. \n\nFor example, the final part of the Sumeru Archon quest had terrible pacing. After every part of the plan you had to have Paimon go back over what just happened, and then on top of that have a flashback to the same topic being discussed around a table.\n\nIt's as if the writers are terrified of the audience not getting what's going on.",
    "This is what you get when Gamers complain about Localization being \"too inaccurate\"",
    "I think one of the reasons why you get this feeling, is because the content isn't that interesting. I usually skip all dialogues that's not related to story quest/character quest/side quests. The rest is an automatic skip except for some interesting encounters or events but the majority I have no time to know why this random person in the middle of nowhere wants to test this potion for whatever reason or other such nonsense. Also keep in mind that characters like Katherine where you have to keep going through the stupid dialogue every time, aggravates the problem. That's my take on the excessively boring dialogues.",
    "This game ruined my ability to enjoy and read rpg text without skipping.",
    "Don't blame the writers, they get paid by the word :)",
    "this is strictly the reason why I don't read any of genshin's dialogue lines, this game's quests are a nightmare for someone with untreated ADHD",
    "\"Profound level academic language\" I never had this impression and thought the dialogue was greatly dumbed down. I thought this is what the other players' impression as well. Like compare this to Honkai's writing. It's night and day difference.",
    "It's not just the dialogue. All the text in the game is so tiresome. The skills are like 10 lines of text when it could be only 2 if they stopped giving names for every move that already exist.",
    "English is not my native language, but I rather play this game in english than in german, because it's even worse in german, especially with all the items and stats etc.",
    "I haven't noticed it being particularly refined or hard to read. Some characters like Zhongli are a bit formal, but not extraordinarily so.",
    "I was giving it a pass because we were in academic sumeru but the most recent story quest p much nailed this feeling for me too. The dialogue was awkward at best, filler at worst",
    "Yeah, the dialogue is extremely bloated and boring most of the time. Just a slog to read.\n\nThe presentation doesn't help either, I am of the firm belief that if they had 2D VN style drawings of the characters that pop up with the texts, and maybe some short voice lines (like \"hmm\", \"huh\" etc, as it is in many VN's) the experience would already be miles better. The recycled animations are just not expressive enough, and the fact that you need to wait for them to finish to skip to the next line (I finish reading the lines before all the animations conclude usually) just makes it worse.\n\nAnd I am someone who likes long dialogue, my favourite series is Monogatari after all. It just needs to be engaging.",
    "I just want them to talk lol. I'm sick and tired of reading so i'm barely even doing it anymore.           \nThey made like 700 million from that one Raiden Rerun and yet they **\"can't\"** or don't want to afford general Voice Actor's since then",
    "Ngl, The major thing i hate in genshin, is the dialogues. it feels unnatural and way too formal. how can i kid having so much formality at the age of fucking 6.\n\nthat being said, let me introduce you to the dialogue writing of blue archive. its simple and feels natural. they are mostly informal yes but at least you wont find yourself bothered why this kid or this individual who doesnt have any resemblance of being literate has complicated way of speaking\n\nalso\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***SKIP BUTTON DOKO.

    "Also, dang...it's only been a day and you've already received a death threat. 💀",
    "while in Chienese one word can have multi layered meanings, English is more direct. I suppose this is a result of high context vs. low context culture. So when translating, it becomes longer",
    "Dude the conversation to set up the current potions event felt like it went on and on with no one saying anything that matters.\n\nI suppose as a rule when translating for games you probably dont want to cut out huge amounts of dialogue even if it seems like fluff cause you dont want to lose important context but like, theres soooo much fluff.",
    "Its disrespectful of the player's time that the dialogue is so often bloated, excessively long, and doesn't have an option to skip right through. \n\nI really wish they had a skip button or at the very least broke out the superfluous details so that if you want more detail you can option to talk to characters after the main point is done but you're also free to just go off and do the quest. \n\nSay what you want about FFXIV but it's vastly superior when it comes to just the way it delivers story and the options it gives players and that game is significantly older than Genshin (instant line skips (no weird delay), skip entire cutscenes if wanted, warnings about long cutscenes before you start the quest step with the cutscene, dialogue history in the chat box of you missed a line of text)",
    "My biggest complaint is how many names, nicknames, titles, code names, etc each person, place, and thing has.  Again this new patch, the first conversation you have with that guy in the new desert and the spirit.  He starts piling on all these names and places and some words even have the translated meaning above it.  Like, I just want a straightforward story.  \n\nI don’t want to hear about how “the -abc- is a guide for the -def- who protects the -ghi- which is also known as the -jkl- and the traveller (also known as the -mno) must gain the blessing of the -pqr- to become the -stu- to open the gate to -vwx- to defeat the -yz-“",
    "It's because they take 800 pages to tell a 150 page story, and all the pointless fluffy dialogue they throw in to artificially extend the \"content\" IS super exhausting.

    "Hi, teacher here!\n\nPlease don’t feel guilty about this. Reading is fucking hard and takes a lot more brainpower than you realize. \n\nI don’t just mean looking at the letters on the page and knowing what words they create. I mean really knowing what the author is trying to say and cross-referencing what you see with your own set of knowledge and experiences to derive meaning. It’s really easy to get fatigued, especially when the readings is separating you from those good good dopamine hits of the action gameplay.",

    "I like the overall narrative of the game and pay close attention to every voiced cutscene, but the writing quality, at least in English, is poor. Whoever wrote this script has never heard the word \"brevity\" before.",

You can even just speedread it instead of waiting for the voice actor to get to them. Bonus rule: Skip everything Paimon says because it is irrelevant 98% of the time. I also dont even bother reading the traveler prompts.",
    "TL;DR: Translation Industry go BRRRR lol\n\nBecause Translation. Look, Asian languages are context-based languages. That's a general theme. This inevitably means that you say less but actually are saying an entire sentence.\n\nSo it's because of this wonderful clusterfuck that whenever you translate something simple from an Asian language into English, that you'll just get a super long description of what happened - while funni guy from Tokyo *actually* just spoke like 5 words or so.\n\nFunnily enough tho, sometimes this works in reverse too. That in English you say less than in some Asian languages. ***I'M LOOKING AT YOU JAPANESE*** loanwords, man. Just loanwords.\n\nSo what why and how? HUUUH?!Solving this problem would be simple as translator, right? Just write better translations, right?**HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAH**^(Notice my increasing lost in sanity in this statement)\n\nBASICALLY - *This* issue lies in the translation industry. And yes, yes there's an industry for that.\n\nTranslator contracts are as per usual something along the lines of \"Translate this literally into this\" or \"Translate this contextually into this\" or culturally, etc. etc. it's all more or less expensive depending on what the customer want to pay.\n\nProblem we got here is that companies are trying to cut budgets anywhere and everywhere which - you're right if you guessed it - also applies to translators being chronically underpaid / working for cheap. That means that the customer gets what they pay for as skilled translators won't sell their skills for less than standard rates and the ones who do *pretend* to be skilled but really aren't.\n\n^(This isn't a jab at people specifically, I've literally seen enough LinkedIn posts of rookie translators that want to know how to work in an industry but they don't want to actually indulge into the source material. Bitch do your homework!)\n\nSo to finally answer your question definitely:*Why is the translation in Genshin so long? It's thanks to*\n\n*A - The translation has been done by a rookie translator*\n\n*B - miHoYo decided to cut costs and went for a cheap contract*\n\n***YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY***\n\n***^(Thanks for coming to my TED Talk)***",
    "I cant keep up with the million different names for things in the new Sumeru quest…",
    "Honestly? Their localization team for English is kind of inconsistent and they make a lot of weird choices. I play Honkai Impact 3 as well and that game is even wordier if you can imagine. It’s also clearly got the cheaper team, as there are literal errors in translation rather than adaptation choices. To be fair though, they are attempting to translate some gnarly SciFi concepts so I tend to let some awkward phrasing and strange grammar go. \n\nI do, however also play Genshin in Chinese audio with my Chinese wife. I can’t tell you how often she comments something along the lines of “what? Why did they translate it that way?”  For context: she is American but learned Mandarin first. She sounds like she’s from Midwest America - literally could be a news broadcaster, but Mandarin is her first language. I say this to explain that she has all the western and Chinese cultural contexts needed to assess the translation quality and… yeah, it’s really weird. \n\nAs an example, she’s particularly thrown by the choices with Nahida’s dialogue. She… doesn’t say stuff like “dooky” in Chinese. As in she’s not even making the same reference or anything close. She’s just sounding kind of childish but not nearly in that way. \n\nSo while, yes, there’s a lot to digest to begin with (which is just kind of a thing for Mihoyo), I think they also struggle sometimes to find a good balance with their English localization teams specifically. I know a decent amount of Japanese and I have to say I think the CH—>JP is much cleaner and closer to the original. This isn’t really surprising tho, as Japan actually has a thriving voice actor/ dubbing industry and in the west your only option for good English voices are a) British actors or b) about five specific people who dub games. \n\nDon’t even get me started on English VAs pronouncing everything wrong and differently every time while insisting they were told to do it that way. 🤷‍♀️\n\nEdit: this comment was specifically thoughts on things like the example including a strangely well spoken four year old lol. I think the other commentary covered the rest well enough",

    "I'm pretty sure it's half due to the translation and half due to the way HV handles its stories. Chinese is a very complex language, so I'm not surprised that the paragraphs and paragraphs of text are typically translated in this way. HV also loves to pack its stories full of random dialogue and info, which doesn't help. They want people to be invested in their stories, so they shove it down our throats (main reason there isn't a skip feature.) I enjoy the story, but I'd rather get it done with sooner than later.",
    "Its because its translated from chinese. Many Chinese games have same problem. Mainly Arknights.\n\nChinese is a fairly advanced language over primitive English. They just have words that have a meaning of entire sentence in English ans cannot be translated word to word. So one character in Chinese equals whole sentence in English.",

    "For about the last year I've had the dialogue set to Japanese at volume 1 so I can pay attention to literally anything else while I click through pages upon pages of unnecessary dialogue without even reading it. I've played plenty of MMOs with bad dialogue that I've skipped over before, but never one that holds you captive to it like Genshin.\n\nThey've proven that they know exactly how to make a dialogue choice system where you can ask for more information if you want it (all of the final archon conversations at the end of each region) but they outright refuse to use it. Instead they use dialogue choice as the equivalent of Netflix's \"Are you still watching?\" so you can't auto through everything, and the main character continues to add nothing of value to conversations while NPCs spew an entire dictionary at them.",
    "Having played in Japanese as well (native English speaker) the dialogue is still quite bloated even there.

It's unfortunate because it really brings down my enjoyment of the game. The lore is beautiful at times but the dialogue writing is laughably bad.",

    "Typical western localization which adds tons more words that wasn't in the original.  The base game already has way too much filler dialogue.  But the localization adds even more.\n\nThis isn't limited to just Genshin.  Many games get this treatment.  Especially SquareEnix games.  [Japanese character will literally say 1 word \"Sayonara\" and the English will translate it into two sentences.](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_original/kvry1xs6jr5wkylvxfme.jpg)  Not only is it inaccurate, but it completely changes the intended pacing and tone of the scene from the original.  Though there are other games, like Bravely Default and Final Fantasy, where the original characters talk way too long even in the original.\n\nWhen it comes to Genshin, it's kind of both happening at the same time.  The game has tons of filler dialogue and characters really do go on saying 10 sentences when they could express the same thing in 1 (*cough* Aranara).  But the English localization also makes it far more verbose than the original.  A few times this is necessary.  You can't express some contextual things from Chinese to English.

    "It does? It just fine for me, it just the Nymph Dream lore sets that is confusing but NPC not so much",
    "It's pretty simple, really. Genshin's English translation is done by people who aren't good at English. That's the only possible reason we have abominations like \"crystalline formations known as Amber\", seelies' \"willing followers\", \"weapons and artifacts\" used to \"upgrade weapons\", the two mistakes _on the game's health and safety screen_ that's been there since launch, expressions like \"tuck in\", \"polish off\" and \"cramp your style\" shoehorned sideways into otherwise aggressively academic descriptions/dialogue, and many, many, many more examples.",
    "The amount of redundant and unnecessary dialogue in this game is horrible. It's too the point now I've completely lost interest in the actual story",

    "I stopped playing a year ago because of this and the lack of a skip dialogue button that makes dialogue scroll through lightning fast made it worse. \n\nThe thing I loved about GI when it first came out was exploration. I knew I needed to finish Inazuma so I could be ready for Sumeru and I was also falling behind in the story. I knew this because some events were locked behind story progression so I tried forcing myself to click through the overly complicated dialogue, but it just tired me out so I stopped playing. \n\nSo here I am now, I kinda miss the game but I don't miss the story and I don't want to click through multiple lines of text that don't interest me in the slightest.",

I felt that to be true for Nahida's Archon quest. But I find that almost every NPC has much too much dialogue. While simple is not always better I do get really bored after a while. \n\nI've been doing the in the Golden sands quest and it's like every 3 minutes we're stopping so the scholar can continue to berate the eramites. It Isn't necessary to take a stab at every single sentence. But yet 90% of the time that's what dominates the conversation that lasts for way too long. It just makes him look to be a petulant child. Great he's an arrogant dick we know. \n\nIt's not that there's anything wrong with the message they're trying to convey, it's that in most cases I find it's they repeat themselves way more frequently than is absolutely necessary.",

I don’t mind reading more difficult or obscure words, as long as it feels natural to character and situation.

    "I kinda get this. Most of the time I just skim through and get the gist of it. I don’t bother reading the whole thing, unless it’s an archon quest or some interesting lore in the world quests. But the story quests have voice acting, so that’s not an issue.",

    "My native language isn’t English so when there’s a new questline (like the Pari one) I really really struggle sometimes to fully understand what is actually going on. It gets super tiring to read everything, they add 30 new words for things (especially love it when its a new word for an already made up word) and I sadly lose interest. I really really tried with the Pari one but when the characters then also additionally start speaking in riddles I just couldn’t…",

    "Sometimes I want quests to be short",
    "It doesn’t help that even when you do read it, every damn line of dialogue has its own different weird delay before you’re allowed to move past it onto the next one so it often ends up either skipping lines you didn’t read yet if you’re mashing or forcing you to wait before the next line if you’re not. This game tries really hard to make sure you don’t enjoy reading it.",
    "What irks me more than the way characters often express themselves in a way which sometimes feels unfitting for their background, is the bload of unnecessary info which THEN always gets repeated and/or summarized by Paimon.\n\nIt's like you're always getting the sophisticated AND the simplified Paimon version for every fucking dialogue. \n\nI feel like I am sitting there at least thrice the time it would take to just deliver the point.",

Usually done by Paimon.\nOptional Step 3: In case they told you something that would spur you on to make an opinion of your own (God forbid!), they immediately tell you in a third line of dialogue what they want you to think about what you just heard. Done by an NPC, Paimon or a single choice option dialogue by the traveler.\n\nAnd to do all this, they use at least four times the amount of dialogue they would need with proper good writing and respecting their audience's intelligence.\n\nIt's the dialogue being iffi that makes it so tiring to read.",

Genshin dialouge is painfully dull and NPCs already take paragraphs to say what could be said in a few sentences, and then Paimon has to summarize, but its somehow even longer.

I know its a meme that Genshin players can't read, but I honestly can't blame any player who doesn't read the dialouge.",

It just takes up so much time and makes me lose interest in listening/reading the story even more, which is a shame because I love Genshin's story.",
    "There's an old saying in film: Show; don't tell. This game can be very verbose, but it also has a horrible issue of \"telling\" rather than \"showing\".

Mostly during the time Nahida took over Katherine's body.\n\nAnd the only time i have paid attention (and i tried) during the desert questline with Jeht and Jebrael was at the very very end when the antagonist of the quest sat on that throne and what followed. \n\nIm deliberately not spoiling anything because i didnt touch that stupid desert questline for weeks when i got lost in a temple and only finished them today.",

    "I dont even think its cause of the amount of words. Its the text speed. I've played a lot of visual novels with probably 10x more reading but I never felt exhausted reading them like I do in Genshin cause I can always toggle the text speed. The text generation in Genshin way too slow it feels dragged out and makes the dialogue feel more padded then it actually is.\n\nIt's less of an issue in Chinese since each word is usally just 1 character long. While in english 1 word usually contains 5 or more letters. So a short sentence in Chinese that takes 5 secs to read and generate would take up to 25 secs to generate and read in english. \n\nA lot of the issues with Genshin's dialogue can be sovled by just giving the player the option to toggle the text speed.",
    "I would argue that the ridiculous amount of text HEAVILY reduces the amount of nuance in the dialogue. I would INFINITELY prefer a smaller amount of deeper and more thoughtful dialogue boxes than the headaches this game keeps giving me every time I do a stupid NPC commission. Then again, there are plenty of other ways to increase the amount of nuance in Genshin conversation that I think should be just as high priority as this is.\n\nEdit: HoYo also shouldn’t force us to do dialogue-heavy commissions more than once, or at least they should give us the option to cut out most of the dialogue every time we do it after the first.",
    "Yep! People typically HATE localization, but I think genshin Imapct’s text really show where translation and localization need to occur. Like I wanna learn more about the lore but when you take like 5 text boxes saying “hi” before you get to important shit then yah.",
    "The bigger problem is they do both at once. Especially in many situations when you compare the other 2 localizations.\n\nEnglish localization has routinely filled out text with fluff while _also_ cutting nuance or changing meanings of things. Largely because it's intentional though. In the same way EN voice directors purposefully request \"bad practices\" because they're standard or do things like purposefully mispronounce names. The state of EN localization is that so many bad things have literally become the norm they're largely expected so localizers maintain them.",

    "Mandarin is a very flowery language by nature. A lot of it is based on idioms from literature and visuals and thus literal translations end up being wordy and verbose. It takes less characters to portray complex prose/ideas than in phonetic scripts as well. \n\nFor example, in Chinese you might have someone say \"bashing his head against a wall until bloody\" to describe what we in English would say is \"futile.\" This can result in localizations ending up quite... wordy when they want to translate things as accurately as possible.  \n\nArknights also suffers this problem, except it might be even worse as their story pretty dense even by Chinese standards.",
    "But not every character is speaking in classical Chinese. Many of the characters are speaking very plainly, and their speech should be translated plainly. Not everyone is Zhongli or a highborn scholar.\n\n\n\nWhen even the potter and the fruit picker are overly verbose, there is something wrong with the writing.",
    "I don't have any experience here, but I just read an amateur light novel translator note earlier today state that 10 CN characters boil down to about 6 English words and that was part of the reason why some chapters were so short.

Huh, so there's gonna be \\***multiple rounds**\\* to the Test of Courage?\". \n\nAyato: \"Precisely. There will be a total of \\***three rounds**\\* in the Test of Courage because the event was actually orchestrated by \\***three different parties**\\*. Merchants raised event funding, the Kamisato Clan provided the grounds, and the Grand Narukami Shrine provided consulting services. As such, each of these \\***three parties**\\* have selected one \\***item**\\* for participants to find, so naturally, the event will require \\***three rounds**\\* to determine the winners.\"\n\nPaimon: \"Ah, Paimon gets it.

Paimon I think it might be on purpose or just a side effect of the repetition... which might serve as a tl;dr of the plot, but I would prefer to not need that at all actually).\n\nOther translations have the same issue, though in that case it might be because it... can't really be called localizations which is noticable in the care and the tone just seeming off in addition to it being much text. \nActually it's the opposite of sophisticated translation in some languages, because suddenly characters with very formal tone switch to the most rude/casual phrases ever, which is jarring. \n\nSo it's much text, too much repetition, overly formal phrasing and in some languages at times the whiplash of sudden tone shift which makes it difficult to read because the text just has no flow whatsoever, which is worse because the textboxes move so slow.",
    "And then on top of that, every half dozen lines or so the player is given a dialogue option that basically amounts to \"neutral insubstantial observation\" or \"snarky insubstantial observation,\" and then at the end of some dialogues:  \"Neutral agree to help\" vs. \"snarky agree to help.\"  None of the dialogue options change the outcome of the conversation at all, or even impact its flavor.",

They're capable of doing more--there's amazing cutscenes in game, and Sumeru's archon quest did a much better job of intertwining story with actual gameplay. But the ball still gets dropped far too often, especially in a lot of character quests.",
    "The animations are based off the original audio which is far shorter, so our English version have the animations stop way early.",
    "you are damn right, the only time i feel invested in the story is when theres cutscenes, otherwise i just read half the dialogue and skip because ive seen the exact hand waving animations for the last 2 years, and at this point it is getting so stale that i just stopped playing",
    "Same, I would like to have some new dialogue animations every nation",
    "I have a double click button on my mouse which makes skipping these unimportant mechanics for mini domain events so convenient. Fortunately enough they don't hold any importance to the lore at all. I don't care about some Sumeru Akademiya researcher's thesis, I just wanna whack some mobs with extra buffs.\n\nStory quests though, I try to never skip them whenever possible.",
    "Pretty much any event/temp story i mash x.\n\nLike if it wont be there for any future player that comes in, was it really important?",
    "Yeah, I think people get the idea that the English localization is hard to follow because of long words, but that’s not quite what’s going on. It’s a problem with the style - or lack thereof. The localizers are really not great at establishing “voices” for different characters, and they use about 50% more words than they need. So everything sounds a) exactly the same, and b) WAY too verbose. Not “snooty academic” verbose, just ”rambling old man” verbose.",
    "Another way to put it: sterile. The dialogue itself has no feeling in it. Any feeling we get seems to be all VA.",
    "That’s a nice way to put it",
    "THANK YOU! This is exactly it.",
    "Trying to meet the word quota at all cost is the most academic thing I can think of :D",
    "I'm still relatively new to the game, but I've noticed this as well. It feels very much like its being stretched out to fill a word quota.\n\nIts especially noticeable with some quests over others. I've only recently unlocked and played the Venti and Mona and story quests and was blown away at how much better and concise the quality of writing is compared to practically every other quest in the game.",
    "I agree with your guess. Chinese is my first language and I think it's very common for people to reference things in casual conversations. Also, many words that we use are basically referencing historical events and stories.",
    "I never felt like most people in this thread either until it’s discussed here either. I did notice people being verbose, but I just chalked it down to the game’s fantasy setting, and the only times I find em jarring is with certain characters like Fischl or Venti, which more often than not are played for laughs or are in tune with their characters.\n\nPerhaps, it is because I’ve read too much East Asian webnovels/comics and watched too many animes that I’ve internalized most if not all the language quirks that might appear in translation? Personally, I think people are just illiterate.",
    ">I never got that impression that genshin had academic level dialogue.\n\nIt doesn't, flat-out. If reading were a video game, people would be calling skill issue. The writing in this game is very tractable, probably 6th-grade reading level material. The vocabulary shouldn't be challenging to the average reader. It *certainly* has almost nothing in common with actual academic writing.\n\nI don't mean to denigrate, though. This game has a very diverse audience. OP could be an actual 13yo who just struggles in school a bit. No sweat if so, this is great reading practice. Either way, though, the fact remains that it's not *objectively* difficult content.\n\n>I think it drags out a bit but thats a thing ive noticed in anime fantasy in general\n\nAgreed on both counts. The verbiage is a little bloated, but that's a common failing in its genre.",
    "Me neither, honestly\n\nThis thread is really interesting to me because it feels like there's a pretty radical way in how people are perceiving the world compared to how I do (though I'm pretty sure I'm the outlier here, lol)\n\nLike, I never felt that the dialogue was repetitive, it rarely feels clunky to me, I rarely ever feel like there's unnecessary information being said. If I wasn't a Genshin player and I read this thread, I'd probably go \"Wow this game sounds like a drag, maybe I shouldn't try it,\" but when I'm actually playing the game I *never* struggle with the dialogue.\n\nWorst-case scenario, if someone says something I genuinely don't understand, I can still figure it out from context clues. If someone goes \"I'm so conflobulated!\" or whatever, but you see them crossing their arms with their eyebrows furrowed and Paimon is apologizing over and over, then it's pretty safe to assume that person is pissed off. Even with the limited animations Genshin has, I find myself picking up enough context from body language that most conversations flow quite naturally; at least to me.\n\nAgain, though, I'm pretty sure I'm the outlier here...",
    "Thing is the difference between an anime and a game ( especially a VN type ) is you can afford to do infodumping in a game if writer is too lazy to make a good storytelling. I saw some works surprisingly successfully using infodumping to their advantage but the experience to do that must be quite high.",
    "I find the EN localization text exists in this weird dichotomy of being both highly eloquent and awkwardly translated at the same time... sometimes there are bits of dialogue that use beautiful or advanced phrasing, and sometimes there are bits that read like they were localized by Google Translate.\n\nMakes me wonder if they have a senior localization team that gets a second pass over critical questlines to spruce up the prose while the rest of the game just gets a basic level of translation service.",
    "I’m Chinese and I believe this is also apparent in Klee’s character demo.\nI’ve seen multiple people not being able to finish reading all those words that just flash on the screen. \nThe pace is still a bit too much in the CN version but not nearly as bad as the EN version imo. \n\nI’ve also seen this kind of comments when friends watch a fast paced Chinese movie with subtitles. There just isn’t enough time for even native English speakers to grasp what’s going on.",
    "Arknights is fucking obscene in that regard, it's the main reason I quit.  It was EXHAUSTING to read after a while",
    "It wasn’t just Kal’tsit!?",
    "Bruhhh Arknights. Character asks what did you eat for lunch. The other character: what does lunch really mean to you? What it means to infected? What it means to amiya? Why do we need to eat lunch? Is it really necessary that we eat lunch while infected becomes hunted? .......................... And proceeds to answer all of them.\n\n(Still like the story though)",
    "From what I've noticed it's the EN thats a lot more extra on their dialogues. I sometimes laugh at how some lines are very different in the EN subs with JP dub.",
    "I’ve been revisiting BOTW to get ready for TOTK and after two years of playing Genshin almost exclusively, I think I had forgotten what it was like to play a game that knows how to shut the fuck up when it needs to. \n\nThe NPCs get straight to the point when you talk to them, more or less. If there’s any fluff, it’s minor, and it’s quick to skip anyway. There are a handful of longwinded exchanges but they’re few and far between, and deliberately played for laughs most of the time, like the one Zora who counts out all ten luminous stones one by one when you bring them. \n\nCharacters only drop their life story on you when it actually matters, like the subplot with Dorian. \n\nBig lore dumps are either integrated into the main quest, or optionally accessible via Kass’s songs. \n\nAlso, the silent protag angle actually works because you don’t have a Paimon constantly talking for you, so Link’s dialogue options actually feel like they matter (and they tend to actually get you different responses, unlike in Genshin!!!)\n\nIt’s just…so nice. So very nice.",
    "For all the praise people give to Sumeru in terms of quests (which is only really in comparison to the Inazuma Archon one, I would argue older quests were better), wordcount bloat has been horrendous. The Archon quest stage about returning to the Akademiya and the Scaramouche boss unlock *alone* is longer than *the entirety of Mondstadt arc* simply because of all the dialogue bloat. To me, it negates whatever improvements may be there compared to Inazuma, which was already a low water mark.",
    "Yep, truly feels like they're getting paid by the word count. I gave up reading all this garbage in like 1.0, and just read wiki/watch videos about interesting lore/plot stuff, because youtubers and wiki jannies are more capable at presenting the plot than 10000 billion earning game company.",

    "Razor. Minimum. Speak.",
    "Well, I would prefer a little more nuance as to the nature and consequence of said bad things, but I think the main problem everyone in this thread is bringing up is that they'll use a high enough word count to convey those nuances without actually doing so.\n\nNPC says 'Abyss Order bad,' Paimon interjects pointlessly, NPC provides their unabridged autobiography, Paimon interjects again to complain about being hungry, NPC circles back to 'so anyway, Abyss Order bad' and off we go to fight them without any meaningful detail.",

Part of the reason Chinese is more dense with information is because ~~words~~ morphemes are monosyllabic. Because of this, it is actually slower in terms of syllables/sec in speech.

On multiple occasions I found myself looking up how to read certain characters. But I don't mind it at all. The literature in this game is very finely crafted. I would not be surprised if many of the writing staff hold Master's or PhD in Chinese literature.",
    "This is definitely a cultural thing that runs deeper than localization itself.\n\nIn the United States especially, there is a deep seated hatred for sophistication and a glorification of ignorance. There's also a distaste of complexity and a love of simplicity. To be fair, this preference comes from a totally valid place - the ruling class has been thoroughly screwing over the working class for almost the entirety of the nation's very brief existence. But that attitude obviously has a ton of problems too.\n\nAnyways, it is what it is and it can be pretty difficult to get a great localization even if the team is very talented because there's a lot more going on than rote word translation.",

I play in Chinese and I still think it is verbose. \n\nProblem #1 is that Genshin is just not very good at letting their characters act things out, so they have to explain stuff to you. It's not like having more visual novel like style of presentation can't work either. Blue archive being a notable example.\n\nProblem #2 is paimon repeating stuff and paimon bantering with other people. Though other NPC dialogues aren't that much better either. \n\nThe writer's hard on for archaic Chinese idioms or complex language are the least of my problems, except when it is used to get paimon to act like a moron, which is more common than I would like.",

    "This. The \"paced reading\" is frickin annoying and makes it feel like I can't read quickly, which I definitely can. Basically not ALLOWED to read at a natural pace so I have to wait for the text to finish scrolling out, by which time I've been sitting longer than it would have taken me to read so I just want to keep going.",
    "Oh yes, that's a good point. This is made even worse when they lock you out of the next dialogue box until paimon finished slooooowly twiddling her thumbs, some guy takes his sweet time just to walk up to you or until the camera finished capturing the AMAZING dead eyed expression of nameless NPC man.",
    "> The text generation in Genshin way too slow it feels dragged out and makes the dialogue feel more padded then it actually is.\n\nIt takes like a second for the game to let you show all of the text and another second for it to let you skip the text. It doesn't allow for speed-reading at all. My theory is that the game leaves that time space because of the animations, similar to how character animations in Ace Attorney pad out the dialogue.\n\nAlso, the fact that many scenes outside of the story, character quests and certain events have no voice acting makes them boring. I can stomach 30 minutes of dialogue in Library of Ruina (and by extension Limbus Company) because the Korean voice acting gives it more life than most unvoiced dialogue in Genshin. Same with Arknights, i love the worldbuilding but the story is a fucking drag to read despite having much better visual novel controls than Genshin. Though the same didn't happen with CounterSide because that dialogue is so fun or engaging that i stomach it.",
    "the text speed is awful. The words come out way slower than I read them, and even after the entire dialogue is there I have to wait even longer to skip them. I actually enjoy the quests/lore in the game but being able to speed up the text boxes would make them so much more enjoyable, instead of being such a slog to get through sometimes.",
    ">A lot of the issues with Genshin's dialogue can be sovled by just giving the player the option to toggle the text speed.\n\nEh?!\n\nIn non voiced quests I just click once, so the whole text gets displayed immediately, then read at my usual pace and click again to turn the page.\n\nIn voiced quests I don't care, I listen to the lovely Japanese and try to snipe words I already know. Half the fun of the story for me. :'D",
    "Some NPCs just talk too much. Thinking about combat event \"quest\" dudes, Inazuma talking commission's and things alike. A lot of the new exploration quest chains are unbearable for me. They use words, names and places that I don't know and of they are not explained soon after, I can't remember them and lose interest (in that particular exploration quest chain)...",
    "There's just so much meaningless fluff, it seems clear to me that the localization team needs to fill space to make room for other languages.

But Paimon also thinks that the fluff, and changing of meanings, could both be excused if they didn't, on top of that, repeat the fluff and changing of meanings after they already said it once. Sometimes they even repeat it a third time that The state of EN localization is that so many bad things have literally become the norm they're largely expected so localizers maintain them.\n\nBut Paimon is hungry now, so let's grab a bite to eat, traveler!\n\n(no but seriously, it's like we are reading the graduation paper of a student who has to write a 2000 word essay, but he only writes 500 words and doesnt feel like writing anything of substance to fill in)",

It uses words that are familiar to me, but obscure enough that their very inclusion throws me off - because that's not how people talk. They're not everyday vocabulary words, they're often very literary - but they're not being used in a literary context that requires them. What's presented as regular dialogue is written in formal and tiresome ways, and it's not restricted to 'oh shit we have an audience with an immortal archon, let's be sure to sound respectful and educated' scenes.\n\nA good deal of the game's lore is *already* presented in the form of found fiction, primary sources and records of antiquity; *those* things are written in appropriate language. It's just that this style carries over to the vast majority of conversations that are meant to be casual or commonplace.\n\nI'm doing it, to a certain extent, in this reply; if I were sitting opposite you at lunch having this conversation, I would be adjusting my language accordingly. Not because I think you're stupid, but just because people communicate differently in written and spoken forms. I suspect that the disconnect that a lot of us feel with Genshin's writing is that too often, the writing/localisation team forget that even though they are *writing* these blocks of text, it is all meant to be presented as *dialogue.*\n\nThat, and the shit with Paimon repeating everything endlessly just to make sure the 12-year-olds with limited reading comprehension couldn't possibly have missed the main gist of the conversation, which has the side effect of draining the sanity and patience of adults who understood it just fine the first time.\n\nThere's also further criticism to be had regarding the fact that characters just insist on speaking so much, yet saying so little, but that's another kettle of fish.",

Not really, and hey, it does expand your vocabulary so that's a positive but it certainly does make reading the dialogue less fluid.",
    "Yeah I thought this but I didn't want to sound like a smartass lol. I really don't see how someone could consider genshin's writing overtly complicated, I'm not a great reader or whatever but I've never had issues with understanding whats being said.",
    "I am with you. I like the attention to details and verbose dialogue and don't find them repetitive outside of a few exception. They clearly put a lot of effort into every character's dialogue, playable or NPC and it shows. They only get on my nerve when it's daily commission but that's the nature of dailies. They just suck to do again and again.\n\nMy biggest grip is the formulaic way some of those quests are made. It's always \"talk to 3 npcs\" to move on. They use this same padding trick over and over.",
    "Klee's trailer is an artistic choice. Nobody expects you to actually read it, but there is some information you can obtain subconsciously reading red words. \"Mondstadt\", \"strongest\", \"spark\" etc.\n\nReminded me of Monogatari series, such a cool effect. And if you want, you can watch it second time pausing.",
    "Arknights will have a 10 minute dialogue scene and you'll skip it and the summary will be \"Blaze wants to fight\"\n\nSomehow it takes 10 minutes and 900 words to get there though",
    "I feel you. I'm still playing Arknights, but I haven't read the story since Chapter 3. I have no idea what the story is about. Tried to read an event story recently, and I shit you not, the dialogue between the first level and the second took half an hour to read. Never again.",
    "JP is probably a different case. Japanese as a language *loves* compressing whatever they say. And by whatever I mean literally whatever. It's why game titles and novel titles are usually shortened by mashing the start of a few words together. A title like \"The Farmer that Enjoyed Life\" might be shortened to something like \"FarEn\". McDonalds for them is literally \"makudo\".\n\nAnd you'd think \"okay, we kind of do that with titles too. Devil May Cry becomes DMC, whatever\". But it runs deep in the language itself. Subjects are almost entirely ignored unless strictly needed, and sentences like \"You should cook that steak more\" end up becoming \"cook more\" for them, and rely entirely on context to subsist. Extend that to not just a sentence, but an entire 1 hour movie, a book, or a game, and suddenly you find that the English version of it ends up much, much longer. And it's not even a localization problem. Writing \"cook more\" in English would end up with everyone calling the localization awful, and a pain to read. Deservedly so. It's part of why most JP drama one way or another ends up being about misunderstandings due to wording. They just generally suck at communicating out of laziness.\n\nSadly I don't know enough about Chinese to comment on it.",

    "I’ve read a theory before that genshin purposely does this for the statistics, lol. Your playtime bloats just by going through a quest. No one is allowed to skip.\n\nAnd yeah, Sumeru, despite the “high praise” I keep seeing in this subreddit, already lost me. It is so jargon heavy that I already lost interest towards its story long ago. The fact that most new exploration is locked behind these wordy quests already took the joy out of this game for me.",

The localization is fantastic at times, some skill/constellation/etc names are downright poetic and I still think it’s really cool for example that they chose the word “Euthymia” as a translation for a Buddhist term for the resolution to remove desire. But Genshin is verbose to the point of being bloated. Being wordy isn’t the same as being sophisticated. In fact, in certain cultures, harmonious simplicity is thought of as elegant and sophisticated, definitely not just in the United States. Good writing isn’t just about using a bunch of high-register and obscure words, it’s about communicating effectively. Hard words and rambling don’t instantly make dialogue intelligent.\n\nGenshin is a game. It shouldn’t be wordy ALL the time. I enjoy taking my time and reading leisurely through story quests, I love the writing there. But when I’m trying to finish off my commissions and a random ass NPC is on their sixth dialogue box about the petty chore they’re about to give me and they STILL haven’t gotten to the point, it’s extremely grating.\n\nI also personally disagree that a preference for simplicity, artistically or philosophically, is a “glorification of ignorance.” It’s subjective, but Baroque isn’t considered the peak of art, honestly.",
    "I think the idea has even older roots in, for instance, the English saying “brevity is the soul of wit”; perhaps one can trace it all the way back to the tradition of debate practiced by the ancient Greeks where one can’t afford to bide their time and waste words.

    "It's looked down upon in China too, as going around saying Archaic things would make you sound like a total dweeb. It's just that in video games or certain genres of movies, and especially in literature, its normal to write like this. It's seen as artsy and poetic. The equivalent in the US would be like the technobauble they use on shows like CSI (I'm hacking into the main frame!). Except in English, this typically feels cringe. Maybe a better equivalent is the use of one-liners in movies, meant to express a lot in very little, except in Chinese it would feel like you're being barraged by one-liners.",
    ">In the United States especially, there is a deep seated hatred for sophistication and a glorification of ignorance. There's also a distaste of complexity and a love of simplicity.\n\nNot really. Due to the way the English language works, especially its phonetic alphabet, it's actually very easy to overburden sentences and paragraphs needlessly. This is why in the English tradition of writing you see that concise but well structured writing has always been held up as the hallmark of good prose. \n\nHell, English even has a \"fancy\" word to describe wordy prose that uses far too many words for the value of information: *verbose.* \n\nThe issue with a lot of Genshin writing isn't that it's complex (not at all), it's that it's verbose.",

It's a gacha game, not English literature.",
    "What",
    "Genshin writing isn’t bad, our feeble western cultured minds are too decadent and lazy to understand it, I see I see",
    "You're leaning in the right direction, but the U.S. doesn't glorify ignorance any more than any other developed country. There are certain bombastic individuals who target demographics that are low on the education side and the U.S.'s long-lasting issues related to public education, but the country has still adjusted similar to others with the increased accessibility to information (for better and for worse).\n\nAs we refer to reading, the most popular books in the recent year (2021-2022) include a lot of long-time classics that either have colorful language or are on the wordy side:\n\n* Pride and Prejudice \n\n* Harry Potter (which has reached a younger audience than during its debut)\n\n* Lord of the Rings\n\n* The Great Gatsby\n\n* Jane Eyre\n\n* The Bible, as has been the case for decades now\n\nWith that being said, *there is less reading altogether among adults than in previous years*, but going by research from entities as the Pew Research Organization, this is the result of several factors including:\n\n* Lack of resources or ability to read, matching with the 29% non-readers within rural parts of the US.\n\n* A fast-paced lifestyle where Americans (among others in developed countries) take to reading summaries, footnotes, and short-form media sites (i.e. Twitter).\n\n* A bit of an error with research, as some researchers have worded questions as \"how many books...\"specifically. This skews results, as surveyees sometimes don't report reading from other sources as electronic media or even things like magazines and manga.\n\nBasically, among reading adults, our habits haven't really changed, and a lot of the favorites we see today were favorites from decades ago. Americans still very much enjoy content that would fall into the complex side of things (fantasy, in particular, is among the favored genres, with unorthodox concepts), just there's less reading overall. This doesn't have to do with a glorification of ignorance, given the single parent working 9-5 simply can't afford to read when they have to work and provide for their children.\n\nAs we refer to Genshin, the style of reading OP refers to is more likely related to translation, as certain languages are more expressive than others. In fact, Arknights has been cited as having a similar issue as a Chinese-based game.",
    "If a writer can't explain what they mean in simple terms, they don't actually know what they're talking about. Precision, clarity, and brevity are generally considered to be very important in English writing. Flowery language is generally identified with exaggeration and intentional vagueness, which are (minor) forms of intellectual dishonesty. Which goes all the way back to Socrates and the sophists.",
    "This is the most reductive stance on this issue I could possibly imagine someone taking. You're Americanizing the entire English language, and, by extension, romance languages. Brevity and streamlining fiction has been a thing since Socrates. Its a cultural difference that is thousands of years old. It has nothing to do with your anti-capitalist apologia. Jesus.",
    ">\tdeep seated hatred for sophistication and a glorification of ignorance\n\nI don’t really agree with this. Americans just don’t like when someone makes unnecessary efforts to sound elite, which lines up better with what you said about complexity and simplicity.

It would probably be one of my favorites if it had a different combat system/gameplay loop.\n\nGenshin on the other hand has the exact opposite problem for me: I love the combat, the mechanics, exploring different playstyles and playing around with different characters, but while I can see the love they put in the storytelling, it just can't keep me interested for long periods of time. The flowery text, the overexposition, the slow ass text speed, by the end of a single conversation with an npc I'm just tired.",
    "It's true that you can skip the text crawl and then skip the voices if you read ahead in many places, but as someone rather new to the game who just got to Sumeru, they suddenly don't allow it in the Sumeru. Idk why, but it's super frustrating because I'm very invested in the story but it feels like dragging my feet to get through a scene a lot if the time. The ability to adjust text speed would be amazing.",

You get a few local terms, and they're dropped in slowly. I expect, and hope, that most players will be able to tell you about the Qixing, the Adepti, most of Morax's names, and a bunch of lore and locations. Inazuma tried to do this, but went overboard with the amount of terms. Sumeru dumped as many as they could on you, as quickly as possible, and didn't explain any of them more than once.",
    "Exactly this. It's the repetition that drives me absolutely up a wall. It feels like every line of dialogue in any quest is repeated at least twice, often three times, and sometimes even by the same character, just with slightly different verbiage. And it seems like no matter how many times I complain about this in the surveys, it just keeps getting worse.",

    "Directors deliberately tell VAs to misspronounce names. Overselling/Overeacting to _extremes_ that don't match the scene is often requested because it's just what people are used to from the days when VAs tried to oversell everything because well...all the VAs weren't actors. Localizers still think the idea of dumbing down any references to things that don't fit a typical american mindset is something often worth doing. Scenes will often purposefully be rewritten to fit a further translation better because its still \"vaguely accurate\" which is how you end up with so much missed nuance or having EN giving characters wildly different characterization to the other 3 languages.",

So at the end you either learn to shorten it, talk really fast… or fail at both and then resorting to muttering it really fast so the other person doesn't have to pause awkwardly any longer. \n\nAdditionally I might add, this is all without getting into the mess of loaned foreign words, which Japanese has a truckload of; potentially making it yet more complicated and sentences even longer.",

    "There is a sort of “fantasy video game” register in English, but the Genshin localization doesn’t quite nail it. FFXIV is a good example as it’s well known for its use of archaic language to create a “fantasy” feel. While it’s not to everyone’s taste it’s well executed for what it is and you can tell the localizers are highly literate English speakers. \n\nThe English text in Genshin, on the other hand, veers between “casual” and “word salad” and reads like the work of a non-native speaker who’s fluent in English but doesn’t quite grok English style. Which is probably exactly what it is.\n\neta: I should also say that the quality of the localization does vary a lot - compare the writing of the [3.4 world quests](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dune-Entombed_Fecundity:_Part_I) and the [Sumeru Archon Quests](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Gaze_From_a_Certain_God), for example. There’s a really noticeable difference. The world quest is tedious, hard to follow and full of weird awkward phrases (“the task I bade of you today”) while the Archon Quest lands more on “generic video game” quality. You couldn’t call it snappy, but it does have characters that you can tell apart and plot points you can follow. Which leads me to believe that MHY cuts corners on localizing non-voiced content. I think they must pay native speakers to edit anything an English-language VA is going to record, but don’t bother for everything else.",
    "I studied in China and one of the main differences that struck me with the west is that being verbose in written compositions was encouraged and valued by the teachers. All the western students found that unreadable but the teachers loved that kind of stuff.\n\nThere's definitely a trend which consists in using obscure Chinese characters or terms to appear sophisticated.",
    "Hell, even back in the day you'd struggle to find many writers who praise wordy contemporaries. \n\nIn fact you can find English playwrights and authors complaining about beefy prose all the back to the 10th century.",
    "There are times when you click and it didn't register because of an ongoing animation motion of a character or some other reason and then you click again and it actually skips the line and you have no way to read it back. I still am baffled that they haven't included a log option to see all the previous lines which is very common in this kind of format.",
    "It's also extremely delayed in comparison to similar media. I should be able to click instantly for it to just be full text instead of having like a 3 seconds delay.",
    "Yes, in Liyue there are a few key things like you've mentioned and they are explained well over the course of the Liyue quests. My first experience of *honestly, what the heck are you talking about* was at the start of Inazuma, where they dumped the whole political stuff on me and I had no idea where my head was.\n\nSumeru did this all over again, but even worse. I'm ignorant about the culture Sumeru is based on, I have great trouble pronouncing practically anything (food, places, npcs) and it's just exhausting for me trying to remember all that stuff and then fail miserably. I know it's a me problem, but I don't think the fact that the culture and language is unknown to me should make my experience with the game worse.",
    "Liyue and Mondstadt was interested in selling you their corner of the world.\n\nInazuma was Hoyoverse weebing out.  It's the only place where they ditch conventional English to use a myriad of Japanese terms in just about every description and I know most players won't remember any of them at all.\n\nSumeru they have to make everyone sound smart by explaining everything in detail, and the approach is nothing new.  This has been the gold standard for every event that introduces a new mechanic/device that boils down to \"*go here, push button, beat up aboriginal goblins*.\"\n\nThe irony is the more verbose they get, the less relevant any of the information is to the overarching plot which... It's still mostly \"I want to meet the archons so I can find my twin!\"  Otherwise, the Fatui are team rocket, the Abyss only matters when Dainsleif is present, and Celestia is a boogeyman featuring only a single character who spoke like... ONE line.  Hope the VA is getting paid a pretty sum to remain on standby.",
    "SHE USES FIRST PERSON IN CN?\n\nwhy is she third person in english. Who, and why? This better be misinformation you’re spreading because if anyone actually thought making her speak in third person would be better for the story, somehow, I want them away from all written art forms and localisation.\n\nMy god..",

When you look at the voice direction of games, the quality is often different. The EN dub for the final fantasy series, for example, is phenomenal. Original films or cartoons in EN also have great voice acting, why not just copy the same formula for anime and anime-games?",

    "FFXIV is like the foil to GI.  \n\nBoth games have rather verbose dialogues, but FFXIV makes it chunky and meaningful.  You learn every word is worth reading because you know it's building up to something, even if it's just a joke.  Even much of ARR's dialogue, while constantly feeling disconnected from the emergency currently going on at any given moment, still promises a pay off of some sort.\n\nGI, a lot of the dialogue is just padding with no pay off, and once you learn this, even what little that isn't starts to feel like padding anyway.",
    "Yeah, but I don't think that's what that guy meant.",
    "I think that stems from the fact that they have to put into detail the boundaries of skills, like if this skill can crit or not, if this skill stacks with each other or not, how many stacks, how long each duration stacks and if each are counted independently, etc. But there are games which provide both simplified and detailed descriptions for skills (mostly MOBAs) and I don't see why Genshin shouldn't have that.",
    "But like Fr. As a casual gamer overall, pls. Like I can figure it out, but like eh",
    "I went back to Mondstadt because Sumeru's commissions started going to the desert, and on top of cliffs. \n\n\nI figured I'd save my sanity by listening to Wyatt losing his stupid key for the 200th time than dealing with the Gu Hua disciples, or those two writers who can't resolve their dispute, or delivering medicine back and forth.\n\n\nI wish we would stop or at least have a delay between these same story-ish type commissions. Like on some of them, we've solved their problem. Yet they keep coming back and crying about the same thing. The worst part is they already do this for some commissions so wtf mhy?",
    "Sumeru is like the \"perfectly balanced\" meme embodied in commissions. Half are wonderfully fast, like the mushroom booping. Half are apparently scrapped world quests with camera pans and NPC cast dynamics and all that we have to jump through hoops and mash through 30 dialogue boxes and confirmations to start. Some of the best commissions, and some of the absolute worst.",
    "Thank Nahida our gracious Archont for those mushrooms quests!",
    "Oh you made me miss Notte again. She was the best \"fairy companion\" I've seen so far in that she isn't annoying and her dialogues and lingo are hilarious.",
    "The weird thing is that the Traveler, both genders within Genshin, have fully realized voice over dialogue with defined actors across many facets of the game, but for some reason they've chosen within a vast majority of the player questing dialogue for Traveler to remain silent and Paimon to be the stand-in, essentially. We have Paimon speaking for literally everything we intend to say or do, so it's not like they weren't willing to have a VO do every dialogue scene, but I reckon Paimon's VO has by far the most speaking dialogue in the game...I just don't see why they couldn't have just had that been the traveler instead and skipped the whole partner fairy representative thing.",
    "Fate/Go got it right too. The fairy companion didn't talk and barely shows up (except where the plot needed them).",

    "A-a-and you got it wrong. \n\nTap the skill to turn your skill and NA into special attacks for 3 hits. If the THIRD hit is made by the skill, you create the hydro aura, if it's made by the NA, your attacks get converted into hydro damage, but it's not hydro infusion, they are considered elemental skill damage which can be relevant for some builds. But most importantly, even if you finish the 3-hit string with the NA attack, you still get the special dendro core production buff - just without the hydro aura.",
    "Oh ok then, yea I can agree with that.",
    "Exactly!   \nNot to mention there’s a lot of implication based on just the intonation or how you end a phrase.  Extremely simple examples: 「行きたんですけど〜」”I want to go but~” you don’t finish it because you’re already declining the offer. The receiver knows this, and it’s been clearly communicated at this point.  \n「それはちょっとー」”That’s kind of—“ you hear that and you already know they’re declining.   \nIt’s not that Japanese “loves” compressing everything, it’s as you said— Japanese is long, and when having conversations it’s not like we compress our sentences so much as shorten words (especially loan words). There’s also a lot of implication in how we end our sentences too, that communicate more information.   \n\nAlso the culture itself also plays a role by not wanting to cause the other person discomfort by revealing possible personal information (WHY are they declining?), etc.",
    "Framed another way, this is a game design problem just as much as a writing problem. Paimon’s much-maligned summaries - and she’s not the only one who repeats info, either - should really be optional reading. Other games do this all the time. A character explains something *once* in the cutscene, then if you forget what they said you can talk to them again to recap it, or look at your quest log for a summary.",
    "I feel it can get worse then that when it is pages of dialogue that goes nowhere. Like sure build characters out but not every random npc needs to tel me their back story, goals, and dreams. Overall most dialogue goes nowhere and they don’t let you skip it.",
    "Neeeeever train your Japanese off of anime and subtitles, that's like the 101 everyone will tell you.",
    "It's fine for me cuz my mother tongue is Chinese and I usually understand everything but yeah sometimes the content loses a lot of meaning during localization. First things that come to mind are the Hu Tao rap and the incantation Yelan and Xiao use near the end of Perilous Trail. Perhaps those are too difficult to translate properly. Shame for people who don't know Chinese they're missing out on a lot of intricacies of the literature. Though I would like to think I'm not understanding the Sumeru quests anywhere near as well as middle eastern people.",
    "then i guess different people have different preferences, and I pretty much haven't ever seen complaints from the CN side, but the main idea's that genshin's english translation is still terribly cringe. at least 文言文 in different forms is extremely widespread in many Chinese games, is mandatory reading content in Chinese schools, and is not uncommon for people to bring up in regular convos (some are also extremely well-written in genshin, such as azhdaha's theme and alhaitham's trailer), but you wouldn't see ANYONE use genshin style english irl other than when flexing their vocabulary.",
    "And then there's Fischl.. 🤣",
    "okay the tcg thing makes me so annoyed .. because they dont actually say TCG in chinese? or japanese I think but im less sure of that.\n\nit's just genius invokation (more or less). and the card game ISN'T a tcg, you literally cannot trade any cards.\n\ndrives me nuts. who on the localization team decided to do this? what the fuck.",

    "I can't even tell if you're being sardonic or clever.  Name checks out, I guess?",
    "Fun fact, really old books (18th, 19th century) also had insanely long titles. Cover art was barely a thing back then so titles were often a summary of the plot because there wasn't anything else to fill the cover with. Ye olde perusalbait.\n\nFor example, Robinson Crusoe's full title is:\n \n\"The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by Pyrates. Written by Himself.\"\n\nAnd there's also stuff like:\n\n\"The Spectres, Or, Lord Oswald And Lady Rosa, Including An Account Of The Marchioness Of Cevetti Who Was Basely Consigned To A Dungeon Beneath Her Castle By Her Eldest Son, Whose Cruel Avarice Plunged Him Into The Commission Of The Worst Of Crimes, That Stains The Annals Of The Human Race\"",

    "Exactly! I think you're spot on with that. I was thinking of FFXIV too, because while it's also wordy and there's a lot of stuff that doesn't exactly get to the point right away, it just feels a lot better crafted.

    "Yep, it's not the text speed for me (you can just click) it's the lack of complete log that's the issue, especially when you have people talking part way through quests and you need to tp somewhere but then you miss a line so you either wait for them to finish or suffer u.u",
    "True, I can't really comment on Inazuma as I'm aware of a lot of Japanese culture, but Sumeru was a 1000 times worse. \n\nThere's an Academy with poor spelling, some Sages, the Corps of Thirty, and then many departments and titles which they'll use to the exclusion of English (or whatever language you play in). \n\nThey should keep the weird names to people, food, and locations. The rest should be dripped in.",
    "I really hate the inconsistency of Genshin's use of language. One case that sticks out to me is the fact that, in English (I'm not sure what the situation is in other languages), the Inazuma craftable weapons have Japanese names or Japanese inspired names when almost every other craftable weapon has a name that can be read in English and made sense of (even if they are kinda bizzare sometimes). For some reason that bothers me SO much.",

    "Oh okay. I was just trying to explain it in very basic terms. Apparently the long skill description is inevitable.",
    "Exactly, it was quite amusing when I first touched on the language. On one hand, that aspect is easy for learners (common everyday phases are fixed for memorization); on the other hand, sometimes it feels odd when you’re just a couple syllables in, yet both you and the recipient already knows what you’re gonna say, but you’re compelled to finish the bulk of it out of formality.",
    "Those examples are more not saying the real reason because you don't want to upset the other person over wanting to be short. If you have close friends, you would be more direct for declining (typically).",
    "Definitely so, it's not purely the writing of dialogues that is an issue. But given the same writers could have insisted on different dialogue systems like the industry-standard sane one you denote, or tried to adapt better to this system, means they at least don't see the problem.",

    "Most semiconductors work fine until 105C.",
    "Not really. You don't understand tech much. Even above 50 is fine. It feels uncomfortable to hold but that doesn't mean it's damaging internals. Real damage starts to happen when phone goes above 90. That's why the throttle limit is 80°C. \n\nAnd in laptops, you're fine even if your CPU crosses 90°C. They can handle upto 105°C.",
    "I have an iPhone 11 and play on medium and have never had heat issues. The smaller screen makes it harder to notice a lack of detail in my experience. Again tho that’s on medium",

    "No, it’s not about ambient temperature, it’s about the phone‘s temperature in relation to ambient temperature and humidity.\n\nTo cause condensation the phone would have to be colder than ambient.\n\nMost manufacturers would probably say that -23C is outside the operating conditions though.",
    "It's generally fine to have your outside temperature be -23°C, because there is simply not enough water in the air to cause condensation anymore",

    "I felt that way when I first started, but then I got used to it. I prefer to play on my phone most of the time because Genshin isn’t really a control-oriented game (as in the opposite of Rocket League or Valorant).

    "I have personally used these devices for years. I am telling you for a fact that it does not. Maybe if you’re charging and on a call at the same time.",
    ">This has nothing to do with superconductors.\n\nIt’s a joke. You know Superconduct? The Cryo+Electro reaction in the Genshin Impact video game?",
    "> but the freezer\n\nthey said refridgerator",
    "It can cause damage to the seal , yes . But overall , smart phones nowaday can survive in more harsher conditions . You may remember the hotbox challenge , and also freezing iPhone in a block of ice.",
    "I think the rm7 looks sick too, but agree the 8 looks better.",
    "How long do you expect a modern phone to last? If you think you'll use the same phone for 5+ years then don't play a single game. Phone batteries these days are designed keeping in mind that you'll upgrade to a better phone in 1-3 years. So it doesn't matter if the battery life shortens since you're gonna change the phone anyway.",
    "Software can only throttle hardware by reducing core clock speed or increase efficiency, and although metal does make somewhat of a difference it can’t eradicate heat",
    "I have an Iphone 13 and I can confirm this guy doesn't know what he's speaking. Yes Iphone 13/14 can have consistent 60 fps too bad you can't even hold the phone in your hands cuz of how hot it is.",
    "Perhaps we have a different idea of what warm is? 38-40c on the back of the phone is definitely ‘warm’ for me",
    "Oops. Forgot which sub we’re in.",
    "If your phone heats up to 90C, it won't even last a whole year. Don't tell people it's completely fine, that's irresponsible. Not everyone can change phones on a whim, especially teens who frequent this sub and don't really know how to care for their phone yet.",
    "iPhone 13 Pro and 13 are very different. Pro Max models may also allow for better heat dissipation because of their size and the (graphite?) pad on top of the SoC.\n\nI can confirm that the 12, 13, and 14 Pro Maxes don’t get nearly too hot to hold. Maybe at “max” graphics, but not at “high” graphics.",
    "I also doubt any kind of phone is immune to heat. Energy doesn't disperse itself into the vacuum, it has to be dissipated somehow.",
    "Touching the back of the phone feels no warmer than touching a table next to it\n\nI literally do not know what to tell you.",
    "When did I say 90 is fine????? Go through the comments again. I said 90 is when internal components of the phone start to get damaged. 90 is fine for LAPTOPS. Ffs keyboard warrior.\n\nEdit. A decent Android phone costs less than $300. I know teens who spend that much on the game itself. If they can't even manage that then they're better off buying an iPhone. \n\nGaming in itself is an expensive hobby.",
    "This, especially on phones with no active cooling\n\nEven though it draws less wattage and is relatively efficient, that doesn’t mean the heat randomly disappears, especially with resource intensive programs which utilize all or nearly all gpu/cpu cores",
    "This is literally complete BS. I don’t even know wtf there is to gain from lying about phone temperatures but all the comments from this guy simply aren’t reality, use one for yourself. \n\nNot surprised at the downvotes",
    "Where are these less than 300 dollar androids that can play genshin pls",
    "You said above 50 and up to 90 is fine for a phone. It's not fine, since phones can't dissipate this much heat and will cook the battery much sooner with no external cooling.\n\n> Edit. A decent Android phone costs less than $300.\n\nIf it's nothing to you, it doesn't mean it's nothing for everyone across the world."
